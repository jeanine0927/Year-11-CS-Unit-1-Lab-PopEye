Popeye the Sailor wants to sail from Bluto's Marina to Whimpy's Hamburger Haven, where he will dine with his girlfriend Olive Oyl. The one-way distance for this trip is 18 Nautical Miles. Popeye wants to know how far that is in "regular miles." A Nautical Mile is equal to 1.1508 regular miles. Popeye also wants to know how long it will take to travel this distance. Popeye's boat travels at a top speed of 5.8 Knots (Nautical Miles per hour) and an average speed of 4 Knots.

Write a program to answer Popeye's questions. Your program should prompt the user for: distance in nautical miles, top speed, and average speed.Â 
Your program should compute and display: the distance in regular miles, the estimated travel time in hours at top speed, and the estimated travel time in hours at an average speed.

Here is a sample run:

Message + input : Enter the distance to travel in nautical miles: 18

message + input : Enter the top speed of the boat in knots: 5.8

message + input : Enter the average speed of the boat in knots: 4.0

Output :

The distance to travel in regular miles is: 20.7144 miles

The best case travel time is: 3.1034482 hours at 5.8 knots

The average case travel time is: 4.5 hours at 4.0 knots
